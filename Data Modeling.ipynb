    "### What is data modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Process of creating a visual representation of a whole information system or parts of it to communicate connections between data points and structures\n",
    "* Goal: Illustrate the types of data used/stored, the relationships among the data, and the ways the data can be grouped/organized\n",
    "* Data Models are built around business needs!\n",
    "* Data Models rules/requirements are made upfront or adapted into an existing model\n",
    "* Collect information about business requirements -> translate into data structures\n",
    "* Data modeling employs standardized schemas and formal techniques\n",
    "  * Common, consistent, and predictable way of defining and managing data resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Data Models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conceptual Data Models (Highest Level / Least Specific)\n",
    "* AKA Domain Models\n",
    "* Offers a big-picture view!\n",
    "  * What will the system contain?\n",
    "  * How will this be organized?\n",
    "  * What business rules are involved?\n",
    "* Typically this is created when gathering initial project requirements\n",
    "* Very basic just to see the generic relationships\n",

    "#### Logical Data Models\n",
    "* Less abstract thatn Conceptual Data Models\n",
    "* Generally provides greater details about the concepts/relationships\n",
    "* May indicate data attributes\n",
    "* Will not specificy technical system requirements\n",

    "#### Data Modeling Processes\n",
    "* General Steps:\n",
    " 1. Identify the entities\n",
    "   * Every entity should be cohesive and logically discrete\n",
    " 2. Identify key properties of each entity\n",
    "   * What attributes are important to maintain?\n",
    " 3. Identify relationships among entities\n",
    "   * Specify the nature of these relationships\n",
    "   * Ex: Customer ABC lives at 123 Street and uses XYZ payment method\n",
    " 4. Map attributes to entities completely\n",
    " 5. Assign keys as needed and decide on normalization requirements\n",
    "   * We want to maximize performance and reduce storage space\n",
    " 6. Finalize and validate the data model\n",
    "   * Repeat and refine the data model\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Types of Data Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hierarchical Data Models\n",
    "* Represents one-to-many relationships in a treelike format\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "          o\n",
    "        /   \\\n",

    "    /  \\       \\\n",
    "   1    2       3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational Data Models\n",
    "* Data segments are explicitly joined through the use of tables\n",
    "* Imagine a joined version of the physical data model\n",
    "\n",
    "* Entity-relationships (ER) Data Models:\n",
    "  * Uses formal diagrams to represent the relationships between entities in a database\n",
    "  * Emphasizes efficient storage\n",
    "* Object-oriented data models\n",
    "  * Objects are abstractions of real-world entities\n",
    "  * Objects are grouped in class hierarchies w/ associated features\n",
    "* Dimensional data models\n",
    "  * Designed for optimizing data retrieval in a data warehouse\n",
    "  * Makes it easier to locate information for reporting/retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "* Popular Dimensional Data Models\n",
    "  * STAR schema: \n",
    "      * Data is organized into facts and dimensions\n",
    "      * Each fact is surrounded by its dimensions in a star-like pattern\n",
    "```\n",
    "      a   b\n",
    "       \\ /\n",
    "        o \n",
    "       / \\\n",
    "     c    d\n",
    "```\n",
    "  * Snowflake Schema: \n",
    "      * Like star but with additional layers of associated dimensions\n",
    "      \n",
    "```\n",
    "      a  -  b\n",
    "       \\   /\n",

    "### Benefits of Data Modeling\n",
    "* Makes it easier for stakeholders to understand data relationships\n",
    "* Reduces errors in database development\n",
    "* Increase document consistency / system design \n",
