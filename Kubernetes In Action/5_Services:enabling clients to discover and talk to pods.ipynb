    "## Kubectl Commands\n",
    "* kubectl get service: Gets and displays info on all existing services\n",
    "* kubectl exec {name} -- {bash command}: Remotely runs commands inside an existing container of a pod\n",
    "* gcloud compute firewall-rules create {rule_name} --allow=tcp:{PORT}: Allow external connections to a given node port. \n",

    "## Introducing Services\n",
    "* Reasons that you can't configure each client app to an exact IP address\n",
    "    * Pods are ephemeral\n",
    "    * Kubernetes assigns an IP address toa  pod after the pod has been scheduled to a node and before it's started\n",
    "    * Horizontal scalaing means multiple pods may provide the same service\n",
    "\n",
    "* Service: \n",
    "    * Resource to make a single, constant point of entry to a group of pods providing the same service\n",
    "        * Clients can open connections to that IP and port\n",
    "        * Individual pods can still get moved around the cluster at any time!\n",
    "* Creating services:\n",
    "    * Connections to a given service are load-balanced across all backing pods\n",
    "    * Label selectors are used to specify which groups belong to the same set\n",
    "    * kubectl create svc\n",
    "* Example Service Workflow:\n",
    "    * kubectl exec kubia-7nog1 -- curl -s http://10.111.249.153\n",
    "        * kubia-7nog1 = K8s Node\n",

    "    * Pod processes request\n",
    "    * HTTP resquest is sent back to curl\n",
    "    * Output of the curl command is sent back to kubectl\n",
    "* Service Parameters\n",
    "    * sessionAffinity: ClientIP -> Redirects all requests made by a given IP to the same pod\n",
    "    * targetPort: Protocol or port number for the pod\n",

    "            * Each service gets a DNS entry in the internal DNS server\n",
    "            * Client pods can access the service through its fully qualified domain name (FQDN)\n",

    "* Connecting to services outside the cluster\n",

    "    * If you create a service without any target pods then you'll have to also make an endpoints resource!\n",

    "    * Unlike liveness probes, failures don't lead to pod killing / restarting\n",
    "    * If it later on passes then it's re-added back\n",
    "* A readiness probe can be defined for each container in the pod\n",
    "* In the below example, you can toggle readiness based on checking if a certain file exists or not\n",

    "* Exposes multiple pods that match a certain label selector under a single, stable IP address and port\n",
    "* Makes services accessible from inside the cluster by default, but allows you to make the service accessible from outside the cluster by setting its type to either NodePort or LoadBalancer\n",
    "* Enables pods to discover services together with their IP addresses and ports by looking up environment variables\n",
    "* Allows discovery of and communication with services residing outside the cluster by creating a Service resource without specifying a selector, by creating an associated Endpoints resource instead\n",
    "* Provides a DNS CNAME alias for external services with the ExternalName ser- vice type\n",
    "* Exposes multiple HTTP services through a single Ingress (consuming a single IP)\n",
    "* Uses a pod containerâ€™s readiness probe to determine whether a pod should or shouldnâ€™t be included as a service endpoint\n",
    "* Enables discovery of pod IPs through DNS when you create a headless service"
