    "## Chapter 1: Introducing Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Years ago, software applications used to be monolithic\n",
    "    * Slow release cycles\n",
    "    * Updated infrequently\n",
    "* Now, most applications are moving towards being microservice oriented\n",
    "    * Rapidly scalable\n",
    "* How then do we keep track of all of these deployable components?\n",
    "    * We need automatic scheduling\n",
    "    * We need automatic configuration\n",
    "    * We need automatic supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is Kubernetes?\n",
    "* Kubernetes allows for develoeprs to deploy their applications themselves\n",
    "    * Whenever and how often they want\n",
    "    * Without assistance from the operations team!\n",
    "* Kubernetes provides hardware-neutral operations\n",
    "* Kubernetes is now the standard way of running distributed apps on the cloud / on-premises\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monolithic Apps\n",
    "* Consist of components tightly coupled together\n",
    "* Typically has been developed/deployed/managed as one entity\n",
    "* Changes to one part typically requires a redeployment of the whole application!\n",
    "* Over time grows to be more and more complex\n",
    "* Usually requires a small number of powerful servers to run\n",
    "* If any part of the monolith isn't scalable then the whole app is unscalable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Microservices\n",
    "* Smaller independently deployable components\n",
    "* Communicates with other components through APIs\n",
    "    * APIs are typically programming-agnostic\n",
    "* Scaling is done on a component-basis\n",
    "* Deploying becomes more difficult typically the more services that there are\n",
    "* Since they're done independently, this leads to difference in env requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing Container Technologies\n",
    "* Different software components typically require different environments!\n",
    "* Originally each appolication was isolated to dedicated VMs with the necessary configs\n",
    "* Increasing the number of VMs though increases the man power\n",
    "* Rather than focus on maintaining VMs, use Linux containers instead!\n",
    "    * Keeps them isolated with their own envs while still on the same host machine\n",
    "    * Significantly more lightweight\n",
    "* VMs are now used to isolate groups of applications while as containers isolate individual apps\n",
    "* VM Components:\n",
    "    * Hypervisor: Divides physical resources into smaller sets of virtual resources\n",
    "    * Host OS\n",
    "    * Bare-metal Machine\n",
    "* Container Components:\n",
    "    * Host OS\n",
    "    * Bare-metal Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "* Benefits of VMs:\n",
    "    * Full Isolation \n",
    "        * Containers reach out to the same kernel (security risk)\n",
    "* Benefits of Containers\n",
    "    * Doesn't need to be booted up\n",
    "\n",
    "* How Is Container Isolation Possible?\n",
    "    * Linux Namespaces:\n",
    "        * Ensures each process has its own personal view of the system\n",
    "        * Kinds of Namespaces:\n",
    "            * Mount (mnt)\n",
    "            * Process ID (pd)\n",
    "            * Network (net)\n",
    "            * Inter-process communication (ipc)\n",
    "            * UTS\n",
    "            * User ID (user)\n",
    "        * Each namespace kind is used to isolate a certain group of resources\n",
    "        * To the processes, different namespaces appear as if they're running on two different machines!\n",
    "    * Linux Control Groups (cgroups): \n",
    "        * Limits the amount of resources a process can consume\n",
    "        * Processes cannot hog resources reserved for other processes\n",
    "    * By default each Linux system comes with one namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "* VM Images:\n",
    "    * When you install an OS onto a VM, then install an app inside\n",
    "\n",
    "* Binaries:\n",
    "    * Files typically composed of machine-readable code\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introducing Docker\n",
    "    * Docker is a platform for packaging, distributing, and running applications\n",
    "    * Docker was the first container system to make containers easily portable across different machines\n",
    "    * Images:\n",
    "        * What you package your application / environment into\n",
    "        * Often contains the filesystem and other metadata\n",
    "    * Registries:\n",
    "        * Repository to store Docker images\n",
    "        * Facilitates easy sharing of images between people and computers\n",
    "    * Layers:\n",
    "        * Container images can have components that are shared/resued across multiple images\n",
    "        * Only certain portions of an image need to be downloaded if the others were previously downloaded\n",
    "        * Faster distribution + efficient storage model\n",
    "        * Typically read-only\n",
    "        * Different containers can look at the same files and modify them as they like as they will write to a custom write layer above the read-only layer. \n",
    "    * Docker Flow:\n",
    "        * Developer tells Docker to build/push an image\n",
    "        * Docker builds the image\n",
    "        * Docker pushes the image to a registry\n",
    "        * Developer tells Docker on a PROD machine to run the image\n",
    "        * Docker pulls the image from the registry\n",
    "        * Docker runs the container from the image\n",
    "    * Docker Limits:\n",
    "        * Since all containers run on the host Linux kernel, if a container requires a very specific kernel version then it may not work on every machine\n",
    "        * Containers can only run on the hardware architecture that they were designed on\n",
    "            * You can't run x86 architecture on ARM-based machine\n",
    "                * Hence Apple M1 Problems!\n",
    "            * This is typically mediated by using a VM\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introducing Kubernetes\n",
    "    * We have Google to thank for giving us Kubernetes\n",
