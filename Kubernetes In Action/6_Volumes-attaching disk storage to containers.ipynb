    "## Notes\n",
    "### Introducing Volumes\n",
    "* Kubernetes Volumes: Persistent Storage that can be shared in a pod\n",
    "    * These are not top-level resources like pods\n",
    "    * Volumes are accessible to all containers\n",
    "    * Volumes are maintained even after a container restarts\n",
    "    * For each container, you can mount the volume in any location of its filesystem\n",
    "* Volume Types:\n",
    "    * emptyDir: Single empty directory used for storing transient data\n",
    "        * Best used for sharing files between containers running in the same pod\n",
    "        * Can also be used to just store files too big for the containers memory\n",
    "    * gitRepo: Volume initialized by checking out the contents of a Git repo\n",
    "        * Once you make this type of volume then it won't be kept up to sync unless it's remade\n",
    "        * Sidecar Container: Container that augments the operations of the main container of the pod\n",
    "        * Once you make this type of volume then it won't be kept up to sync unless it's remade\n",
    "    * hostPath: Used for mounting directories from the worker node's filesystem into the pod    \n",
    "        * Does not get taken down when the pod is torn down\n",
    "    * gcePersistentDisk: Used for mounting cloud provider storage\n",

    "## Using Persistent Storage\n",
    "* Above storage volumes aren't good for if you have pods being rescheduled to another node\n",
    "* Needs to be stored on Network-Attached Storage (NAS)\n",
    "* Use the p-storage associated with your cluster:\n",
    "  * AWS: awsElasticBlockStorage\n",
    "  * Azure: azureDisk\n",
    "  * GCP: gcePersistentDisk\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using PersistentVolumes (PV)\n",
    "* PS still kinda requires that the developer have knowledge on the underlying infrastructure\n",
    "  * See NFS storage which utilizes user-defined server specs\n",
    "* Access Flow:\n",
    "  * Cluster admin setsup up some type of network storage\n",
    "  * Admin creates a PersistentVolume by posting a PV descriptor to Kubernetes\n",
    "  * User creates a PersistentVolumeClaim\n",
    "  * Kubernetes finds and binds a PV of adequate size\n",
    "  * User creates a pod with a volume referencing the PVC\n",
    "* PersistentVolumes are resources like pods/nodes/replicators/etc.\n",
    "* PersistentVolumes also don't belong to any namespace\n",
    "  * PersistentVolumeClaims do though\n",
    "* PersistentVolumeClaims is seperate from creating a pod\n",
    "  * You want the same PVC to be available when the pod is being rescheduled\n",
    "* AccessMode Abbreviations:\n",
    "  * RWO: ReadWriteOnce\n",
    "  * ROX: ReadOnlyMany\n",
    "  * RWX: ReadWriteMany\n",
    "  * Note that these are for # of worker nodes, not pods\n",
    "* Reclaiming PersistentVolumes: \n",
    "  * Delete: Deletes the underlying storage\n",
    "  * Recycle: Deletes the content + makes the volume available to future claiming\n",
