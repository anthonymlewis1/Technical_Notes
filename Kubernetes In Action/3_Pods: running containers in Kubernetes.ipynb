    "## Chapter 3: Pods: Running Containers in Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pods\n",
    "    * Co-located group of containers\n",
    "    * Basic building block of K8s\n",
    "    * Pods can contain multiple nodes, but pods can never spand multiple worker nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kubectl commands\n",
    "* kubectl get {resource} -o yaml: Gets yaml manifest for a given resource\n",
    "* kubectl explain {resource}: Gets documentation for a given resource\n",
    "* kubectl create -f {file_name}: Creates a resource from a yaml or json file\n",
    "* kubectl logs {resource_name}: Gets a resource's logs\n",
    "* kubectl port-forward {resource_name} {local_port}:{tgt_port}: Allow for external pod connecting\n",
    "* kubectl label {resource} {name} {key}={value}: Label a resource with a tag\n",
    "* kubectl get {resource} --show-labels: Lists labels associated with a resources\n",
    "* kubectl get {resources} -l {key}={value}: Get resource with an associated label key/value\n",
    "* kubectl get ns: Gets all namesapces in the cluster\n",
    "* kubectl get pods --namespace {value}: Gets pods of a given namespace\n",
    "  * Also -n argument\n",
    "* kubectl create namespace {name}: Creates a namespace\n",
    "* kubectl create {resource} -n {name}: Creates a resource in a specified namespace\n",
    "* kubectl delete {resource} {name}: Deletes a specified resource with a specified name\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why have multiple containers for multiple processes? \n",
    "* Containers are designed to run only a single process (or multiple child processes) per container\n",
    "* Would be difficult to parse through the logs\n",
    "* Would be difficult to restart one process if it fails\n",
    "* Pods then allow for the binding/management of containers as a single unit\n",
    "* Pods allow for you to run closely related processes with the ~exact environments\n",
    "\n",
    "* All pods in a cluster reside in a single flat, shared, network-address space\n",
    "    * Every pod can access every other pod at the other pod's IP address\n",
    "    * No Network Address Translation (NAT) exists between pods\n",
    "        * Similiar communication to a Local Area Network (LAN)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple pods is great for a few reasons:\n",
    "    * Although it's *not illegal* to run a multi-tier app on 1 pod, it's a waste of idle resources\n",
    "    * It's significantly easier to scale horizontally!\n",
    "\n",
    "* When to use multiple containers in a pod:\n",
    "    * Q1: Do they need to be run together or can they run on different hosts?\n",
    "    * Q2: Are they a single whole or independent components?\n",
    "    * Q3: Must they be scaled together or individually?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A container shouldn't run multiple processes\n",
    "* A pod shouldn't contain multiple containers that don't need to run on the same machine\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Pods from YAML or JSON descriptors\n",
    "* yaml and json formatting allows for easy version control for resource deployment\n",

    "* Labels: Arbitrary key:value pair which can be attached to any resource\n",
    "* Generally used for small pieces of information\n",
    "* Resources can have > 1 label so long as the labels are unique\n",
    "* Labels can be modified without need for restarting the resource\n",
    "* Labels can also be used to differentiate between different node requirements in a heterogenous infrasatructure\n",
    "  * Ex if certain pods need access to a more powerful GPU or an SSD\n",
    "\n",
    "* Label Selectors: Filters based on whether they include a specified label\n",
    "* Label Selectors can select resources based on the following:\n",
    "  * Does / Doesn't contain a label with a certain key\n",
    "  * Contains a label with a certain key/value\n",
    "  * Contains a label with a certain key but not with a certain value\n",
    "* Label Selectors can also include multiple comma-separated criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organizing Pods w/ Annotations\n",
    "* Also utilizes key:value pairs, but they aren't meant to hold identifying info\n",
    "* Generally used for large pieces of information\n",
    "  * Ex: descriptions for different resources\n",
    "* Can also not be used to group objects vis-Ã -vi label selectors\n",
    "* Typically will use an annotation over a field when doing alpha/beta work\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organizing w/ Namespaces\n",
    "* NOT THE SAME AS LINUX NAMESPACES\n",
    "  * Linux namespaces isolate processes from each other\n",
    "  * Kubernetes namespaces allows for a scope to group objec tnames\n",
    "* Multiple namespaces allows you to split complex systems with numerous components into smaller groups\n",
    "* Multiple namespaces though don't actually do any isolation of running objects!\n"
