    "* Containers package up *all* libraries/dependencies and deploys it as one package\n",
    "* Similar to VM Generation!\n",
    "    * Rather than creating a whole OS, it uses a Linux Kernel and only requires external dependencies to be packaged!\n",
    "* In many companies, microservices run in Docker containers! \n",

    "* Benefits:\n",
    "  * Will run on any Linux machine regardless of customization!\n",
