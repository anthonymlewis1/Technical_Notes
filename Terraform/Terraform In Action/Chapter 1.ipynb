    "# 1: Getting Started with Terraform\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is Terraform:\n",
    "* Deployment technology for anyone who wants to provision and manage their infrastructure as code\n",
    "* Basic Principle: Write Human-readable config code to define IAC\n",
    "* Infrastructure as Code (IAC):\n",
    "    * Infrastructure through machine-readable definition files\n",
    "    * Automated processes!\n",
    "* Provisioning:\n",
    "    * Act of deploying infrastructure\n",
    "    * This is NOT Configuration Management\n",
    "        * CM typically deals with application delivery typically on VMs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Terraform:\n",
    "    * Provisioning Tool:\n",
    "        * Deploys infrastructure, not just apps\n",
    "        * Immutable Infrastructure: Treat infra as a disposable commodity\n",
    "        * Mutable Infrastructure: Make updates / patches to infra\n",
    "    * Easy to Use:\n",
    "        * I'm dumb so I need things dumbed down for me\n",
    "        * Written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)\n",
    "            * Compatible with JSON\n",
    "        * All config based \n",
    "    * Open Source:\n",
    "        * Free!!\n",
    "    * Declarative:\n",
    "        * Say what you want\n",
    "        * As opposed to functional programming (How to do what you want)\n",
    "    * Cloud-Agnostic: Same tools for different platform\n",
    "    * Expressive and Extendable: Easy to add new functionality via new code\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Writing in Terraform:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Write Terraform Config\n",
    "2) Configure AWS providor\n",
    "3) Initialize Terraform\n",
    "4) Deploy terraform\n",
    "5) Clean up terraform\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting up the Configs\n",
    "```\n",
    "# main.tf\n",
    "# Declare an AWS EC2 instance with an Ubuntu AMI (type) and a name tag\n",
    "\n",
    "provider \"aws\" {\n",
    "region = \"us-west-2\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "data \"aws_ami\" \"ubuntu\" {\n",
    "  most_recent = true\n",
    "    filter {\n",
    "    name = \"name\"\n",
    "      values = [\"ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*\"]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    owners = [\"099720109477\"] # AWS Account ID\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "resource \"aws_instance\" \"helloworld\" {\n",
    "  ami           = \"ami-09dd2e08d601bff67\"\n",
    "  instance_type = \"t2.micro\"\n",
    "  tags = {\n",
    "    Name = \"HelloWorld\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "           \n",
    "* Provider: (provider \"aws\"{ ... })\n",
    "    * Responsible for handling API interactions and exposing resources to Terraform\n",
    "    * Many providers for different systems are noted in the Terraform Registry\n",
    "        * Ex: google: gcp, azurerm: azure\n",
    "    * Providers only have inputs\n",
    "        * Configruation Argument: Input\n",
    "        \n",
    "* Data Source:\n",
    "    * Elements that allow you to fetch data at runtime / perform computations\n",
    "    * TF can only read no control\n",
    "    * In the example, it queries the most recent Uvuntu AMI published to the Registry\n",
    "\n",
    "* Resource: (resource \"aws_instance\" \"helloworld\" { ... })\n",
    "    * HCL defined element for specifcying infrastructure building blocks\n",
    "        * Ex: Used for VMs, load balancers, etc.\n",
    "    * Each resource has an input and an output\n",
    "        * Argument: Input\n",
    "        * Attributes: Output\n",
    "            * Computed / Calculated Attributes: Only available after creation\n",
    "\n",
    "           \n",
    "            \n",
    "####  Initializing,  Applying, and Destroying Terraform\n",
    "```\n",
    "terraform init # Download binaries and lock the config\n",
    "terraform apply # Deploy and run through plan\n",
    "terraform destroy # Destroys created infrastructure\n",
    "```\n",
    "* *terraform apply* creates an execution plan that outlines the actions to achieve the desired state"
