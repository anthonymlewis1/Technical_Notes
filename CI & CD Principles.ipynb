    "* Practice of automating code change integration from multiple contributors into a single software project\n",
    "* Code will typically build/test\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build\n",
    "  * Mortgage Jenkins via webhook\n",
    "  * This already is prebuilt via MTGE ENG\n",
    "  * Typically, an enterprise will have a Jenkins service running\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test\n",
    "  * We have this setup via precommit.sh file\n",
    "  * Typically will house unittests/linting/etc.\n",
    "  * You *could* put this in the Jenkins file but it's much cleaner here\n",
    "  * Environment will either succeed or fail\n",

    "### Benefits of CI\n",
    "* *Non-CI Environment Problems*\n",
    "     * Slow, buggy release of code\n",
    "     * Adds bureucratic costs to projects\n",
    "     * Teams must coordinate when to sequentially launch features / fixes\n",
    "* Enables better transparency/insight into the process of development/delivery\n",
    "* Removes organizational dependencies b/w development of features\n",
    "* Speeds up feedback on code reviews\n",

    "## CD Principles\n",
    "* CD: Continuous Deployment\n",
    "* Software release strategy where code that passes automated testing is released onto the production environment\n",
    "* ***NOT Continuous Delivery***\n",
    "    * Continuous Delivery = Code is handed off to QA/Operations for testing\n",
    "    * Continous ***Deployment*** does not have a time lag from testing to moving onto production\n",
    "* Popular Monitoring Tools: \n",
    "  * Splunk\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of CD\n",
    "* Typically will have scripts/tools that move the artifacts to pulic servers or things like app stores\n",
    "* Eliminates DIY for deployment\n",
    "* Automates repetitive tasks\n",
    "* Deployments are frictionless w/o compromising security\n",
