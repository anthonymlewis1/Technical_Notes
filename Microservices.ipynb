    "    * Simple application is created and developed\n",
    "    * Application becomes successful!\n",
    "    * Users like it and begin to depend on it\n",
    "    * Traffic increases\n",
    "    * Users request improvements/features\n",
    "    * More developers work on the application\n",
    "    * The simple application is now complex\n",
    "* Results:\n",
    "    * Overlapping teams are not independent!\n",
    "    * Code changes collide\n",

    "* Main Idea: \n",
    "    * Applications are simpler to build and maintain as smaller pieces that work seamlessly together\n",
    "    * Isolate software functionality into multiple indepdendent modules that are responsible for defined tasks\n",
    "    * They communicate with each other through APIs\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Microservice App Characteristics:\n",
    "    * Fragmented into modular components with their own discrete functions\n",
    "    * Functions are alligned with business capabilities\n",
    "    * Can be distributed across clouds/data centers\n",
    "    * Can be changed/updated/deleted without disrupting the rest of the application\n",
    "\n",
    "* Result:\n",
    "   * The application can grow as the company/requirements grow\n",
    "   * Each microservice has a clear, non-overlapping set of responsibilities\n",

    "### Microservices and Containers\n",
    "* The service that makes up an application can be placed within containers that are self-sufficient\n",
    "* Containers operate indepdently but still answer to orchestration tools!\n",
    "    * Ex: Kubernetes\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Microservices Key Benefits\n",
    "* Improved scalability\n",
    "    * New capabilities is just making a new microservice\n",
    "        * Not a new application!\n",
    "* Better fault isolation\n",
    "    * Everything still works if one microservice fails \n",
    "* Optimized scaling decisions\n",
    "    * Scaling decisions can be made more granularly\n",
    "* Localized complexity\n",
    "    * Owners only need to care about their own service's interior design\n",
    "    * Clients only need to care about service capabilities\n",
    "* Increased business agility\n",
    "    * Enterprises can afford to experiment with new processes/algorithms/business logic\n",
    "* Increased developer productivity\n",
    "    * You only need to care about your own service\n",
    "* Simplified debugging and maintenance\n",
    "* Future-proofed applications\n",
    "    * New technologies can be easily integrated into containers\n",
    "* Smaller and more agile development teams\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microservices Key Drawbacks\n",
    "* Microservice architectures can be complex\n",
    "* Microservices approach requires careful planning\n",
    "* Proper sizing of microservices is hard to calculate\n",
    "* Little control over third-party microservices\n",
    "* Downstream dependencies are difficult to track\n",
    "* Multiple microservices are easier to hack"
