    "        * \"Continuing to work correctly, even when things go wrong\n",
    "* Faults != Failures\n",
    "    * Faults: When one component deviates from its spec\n",
    "    * Failures: When the system as a whole stops provididng its service\n",
    "* How can we best ensure reliability?\n",
    "    * Increase the rate of faults by triggering them deliberately!\n",
    "    * Test how truly fault-tolerant your system truly is\n",

    "* Common Faults:\n",
    "    * Hard disks crashing\n",
    "    * RAM becoming faulty\n",
    "    * Unplugged cables\n",
    "* Given a 10,000 storage cluster with a mean time to failure (10, 50 yrs), one can assume an average failure of 1 / day\n",
    "* As there is a larger need for data volumes/computing demands, these applications require even more machines, increasing the failures/cluster. \n",
    "* How do we deal with this:\n",
    "    * Add redundancy to reduce the system failure rate\n",
    "        * Physical: Hardware components can be duplicated\n",
    "        * Software: Patched systems can be patched one node at a time\n",

    "#### Software Errors\n",
    "* Systematic errors are correlated across the nodes rather than on a singular node\n",
    "* How do we deal with this?\n",
    "    * Evaluate and question your assumptions and system interactions\n",
    "    * Create robust and detailed error logging\n",
